# Q#, the language for Quantum computing

## What is Quantum Physics?

> In general, Quantum Physics is how mechanics works at very very small dimensions, like eletrons, positrons and so on...

> According to Niels Bohr, the father of the orthodox ‘Copenhagen Interpretation’ of quantum physics, “Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it”. Richard Feynman, one of the founders of quantum field theory remarked, “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum theory”.


Disclaimer: My intention here is not teaching Quantum Physics (I have no guts for that) So here you go a list of very useful papers about it
